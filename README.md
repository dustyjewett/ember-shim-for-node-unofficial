# Ember Shim for Node (Unofficial)

A simple hack to pull in the bower release and export it.

## Install

    npm install git@github.com:dustyjewett/ember-shim-for-node-unofficial.git
    
## Usage

Ember is not available to import into node! You can write standard node with require('ember').

OR, even better, run your existing ember code with Babel es2015.  See: _
